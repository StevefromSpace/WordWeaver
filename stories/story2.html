            <div class="story-content">
                <p>
                    In a wide, grassy valley, there stood a 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Extremely beautiful, impressive, or elaborate.">magnificent</span> 
                    Oak. He was enormous. His trunk was thick and 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Having a rough, uneven surface; strong and tough.">rugged</span>, 
                    and his branches spread out like a crown, reaching for the sky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was very proud of his power. "Look at my 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="The base or underlying structure on which something is built.">foundation</span>!" 
                    he would boom to the other plants. "My roots go deep, and my wood is hard. I am the strongest thing in this valley. I fear nothing!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing not far away was a 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="A small group of trees.">grove</span> 
                    of slender Bamboo. They were tall and green, but very thin. When the smallest puff of wind came by, they would shiver and sway, their leaves making a soft shhh-shhh-shhh sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The towering Oak looked at the Bamboo with 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="A feeling of contempt or disrespect.">scorn</span>. 
                    "You poor, 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Weak and easily broken or damaged.">flimsy</span> 
                    creatures," he scoffed. "You are always dancing and bowing. You bend to every little breeze! Why don't you grow a strong trunk like mine? You must be 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Very frightened.">terrified</span> 
                    of everything."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bamboo rustled kindly in reply. "Oh, Mr. Oak," one of them whispered. "We are not afraid. We just know that it is wise to be 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Able to bend easily without breaking.">flexible</span>. 
                    We do not mind bowing."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Hmph!" grunted the Oak. "Bowing is for the weak. I never bow. I stand firm!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    One evening, the sky turned a dark, angry purple. A great 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="A powerful and violent tropical storm.">typhoon</span> 
                    was coming. The wind didn't just blow; it HOWLED. It screamed through the valley, pulling at everything. The rain 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="To strike or beat violently.">lashed</span> 
                    down sideways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I will not be moved!" shouted the Oak. He puffed out his branches and held his massive trunk 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Stiff and unbending; not flexible.">rigid</span> 
                    against the blast. He was a stone wall against the wind. "Let the storm try! I am stronger!" The wind hit him, and he groaned, but he did not bend.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, the Bamboo were doing something very different. As the 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Extremely angry, violent, or intense.">furious</span> 
                    wind attacked, they did not try to fight it. They bent over, lower and lower, until their graceful tops nearly touched the muddy ground. They let the howling 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="A very strong wind.">gale</span> 
                    rush right over their backs. They looked very small and weak, but they were safe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The storm grew even more powerful. It saw the proud Oak standing tall and hit him with all its force. "NO!" 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="To shout in a deep, loud voice.">bellowed</span> 
                    the Oak, trying to hold his ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the wind was stronger. It pushed and pushed against the rigid trunk. There was a terrible, 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Breaking into sharp, thin pieces.">splintering</span> 
                    CRACK! Because he would not bend, the mighty Oak snapped in two. With a final, ground-shaking THUD, the strongest tree in the valley 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="To fall over suddenly.">toppled</span> 
                    over, his great crown crashing into the earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next morning, the storm was gone. The sun came out and shone on a peaceful, clean-washed valley. But the magnificent Oak was lying on the ground, his hard wood 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Broken into many small pieces.">shattered</span> 
                    and his roots torn up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And just a few steps away, the slender Bamboo slowly stood back up. They were a little wet and muddy, but they were completely 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Not hurt or damaged.">unharmed</span>. 
                    They rose up, thin and green, and began to rustle softly again in the gentle morning breeze.
