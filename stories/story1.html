                    Elara arrived at the

                    spire just as the sun began to set. The tower was tall and made of dark, crumbling stone. The villagers had warned her about this place, telling tales of an

                    light that shined from the top window every night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She pushed open the heavy wooden door, which groaned in protest. Inside, the air was cold. A spiral staircase twisted up into the darkness. "Hello?" she called out, her voice sounding small. There was no reply but the echo of her own words.

                <p>
                    She

                    the stairs carefully. Halfway up, she found a small, leather-bound book on the steps. It was covered in dust. She opened it, but the writing inside was

                    and faded. It spoke of a "hidden star" and a "sky-key."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, she reached the top. The room was empty except for a single, powerful telescope pointed at the sky. Elara looked through it and gasped. The "eerie light" wasn't a ghost at all—it was the bright, focused light of the planet Venus, shining so brightly it looked like a lamp in the window. The "mystery" was just astronomy.
