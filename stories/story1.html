                <p>
                    Once upon a time, in a wide, green meadow, grew a great, strong Oak Tree.
                    His trunk was thick, his branches were wide, and his leaves were dark green. 
                    The Oak was very proud. "Look at me!" he would boom in a deep, woody voice. 
                    "I am the strongest tree in the world! I am 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Very large, strong, or impressive.">mighty</span>!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next to him grew a 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Thin, in an attractive or graceful way.">slender</span>, 
                    green Bamboo. Bamboo was tall and thin. 
                    When the wind blew, he would dance and 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="To move or sway back and forth.">sway</span> 
                    and 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="To make a soft, crackling sound, like dry leaves.">rustle</span> 
                    his leaves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The proud Oak Tree often laughed at the Bamboo. "You are so thin and weak," the Oak would say. 
                    "You bow and bend to every little breeze. You should be strong, like me! 
                    Stand up straight! Never bend!"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Bamboo just smiled his rustling, leafy smile. 
                    "Oh, Mr. Oak," he whispered. 
                    "Your strength is wonderful, but I like to sway. 
                    Bending is how I dance with the wind."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Nonsense!" huffed the Oak. "Bending is for the weak."
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day, a great storm came. The sky turned dark gray. 
                    The wind didn't just whistle; it ROARED. The rain didn't just fall; it POURED.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Ha!" boomed the Oak Tree, trying to sound brave. 
                    "I am not afraid! I am strong! I will not bend!"
                    He spread his branches wide and held his trunk 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Firm or unmoving; not giving in.">firm</span> 
                    against the 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Violent, wild, and uncontrolled.">raging</span> 
                    wind. The wind pushed and pushed. 
                    The Oak strained and groaned, holding his ground with all his might. 
                    He would not move an inch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beside him, the Bamboo was dancing wildly. 
                    The wind howled, and the Bamboo bent. 
                    He bent so low that his leafy top almost touched the wet ground. 
                    He swayed and whipped back and forth, but he did not fight the wind. 
                    He simply bent with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Poor, weak Bamboo!" shouted the Oak over the storm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But the storm only got stronger. The wind gave one GIANT PUSH. 
                    The proud Oak Tree held his breath. He tried to stand firm. He would not bend!
                </p>
                <p>
                    CRRRRRAAAAAACK!
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a sound like thunder, the Oak Tree’s thick trunk 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="To break suddenly and completely.">snapped</span>. 
                    He came crashing down to the ground with a mighty THUD. 
                    His strong branches were broken, and his proud leaves were 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="To spread or throw things around in an untidy way.">scattered</span> 
                    in the mud. He had been too strong, too 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Stiff; not able to be bent easily.">rigid</span>, 
                    to survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next morning, the sun came out. The birds began to sing. The storm was over. 
                    The mighty Oak Tree was lying on the ground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And right next to him, the slender Bamboo stood tall. 
                    He was a little wet, but he was not broken. He had a few leaves missing, but he was standing straight and smiling in the sunshine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He looked down at the fallen Oak with kindness. 
                    "You see," the Bamboo whispered gently. "Sometimes, it is better to bend than to break. 
                    Being 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Able to bend easily without breaking.">flexible</span> 
                    is its own kind of strength."
