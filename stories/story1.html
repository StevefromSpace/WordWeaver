                    In a quiet forest clearing, a tiny 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="A young tree, especially one with a slender trunk.">sapling</span> 
                    pushed its way out of the soil. It was small, but it held a powerful spirit. Years turned into decades. The sapling grew, its branches stretching towards the sun. It became a 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="Strong and healthy; vigorous.">robust</span> 
                    young tree.

                <p>
                    Squirrels chased each other up its

                    Birds nested in its branches, finding a safe

                    from predators. The oak learned to be patient, drawing water from deep in the earth and soaking in the sunlight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It grew into a

                    oak, its trunk wide and its leaves forming a vast

                    that provided shade for the entire clearing. The tree endured fierce storms and 
                    <span class="vocab-word" data-definition="A long period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to water shortage.">droughts</span>. Its deep roots held it firm when the wind howled.

                <p>
                    The other creatures of the forest came to see the oak as a

                    It was a home, a source of shade, and a

                    to the power of patience and strength.
